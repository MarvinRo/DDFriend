# THIS APP IS A CREATION OF MINE FOR MY FRIENDS AND I WHO LOVE TO PLAY TOGETHER

# TO START THE APPLICATION CODE JUST INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES WITH:

- npm i or npm install

# YOU SHOULD CREATE A FILE .ENV AT THE ROOT OF THE FOLDER TO USE THE FIREBASSE ACCESS KEY
# EXEMPLE .env

- GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID= "access key for your firebase"

# AFTER THAT JUST START THE SYSTEM AS YOU SEE FIT.
